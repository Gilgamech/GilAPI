Working with Node has been, for the most part, pretty fun. The hardest part of writing a modern website/webapp - for me at least - is making it pretty on mobile. Actually - that's the second-hardest part. The hardest part has been sorting out Passport authentication. Part of why I'm writing this is to help me gather my thoughts. 


Passport:
Mostly works currently - successfully passes loginFailure when given no password. 
- Requires:
- Functions:
- Strategies:
- Pages: 
- DB: 

Options: 
- Local Dev (Need to setup NPM)
- Reference Build (Tried with Enkida - passes tests but fails on Heroku)

Write blog post, use this to lay out ideas about how it works. Reference HackerNoon post. 


Go research forex strategies - don't reinvent them. It's faster.

Min Spread = 

OutputCurrency = ActualSalePrice - ActualBuyPrice
OutputCurrency = ActualSalePrice - ((InputCurrency - Fee )  * ConversionRateA)
OutputCurrency = ((ConversionRateB * SalePrice) - Fee) - ((InputCurrency - Fee )  * ConversionRateA)
OutputCurrency = ((ConversionRateB * SalePrice) - Fee) - ((InputCurrency - Fee )  * ConversionRateA)

BuyPrice = ConversionRateA * InputCurrency
ActualBuyPrice + (InputCurrency - Fee )  * ConversionRateA
OutputCurrency / SalePrice = ConversionRateB
OutputCurrency = ConversionRateB * SalePrice
ActualSalePrice = SalePrice - Fee
Spread = ActualSalePrice - ActualBuyPrice
Profit =  SalePrice - BuyPrice

Profit =  SalePrice - ConversionRateB * Input Currency
Spread = SalePrice - Fee - ConversionRateB * InputCurrency + Fee

OutputCurrency = ConversionRate * SalePrice

Target Sale Price = ABP + Spread - fee

Velocity of price changes
Each share has its own sale price? 


Way to find "target" price
More variance at certain times of day? Find patterns?

- I tell Page my Coinbase totals. (It can save?)
- Page calcuates fees and gives a "zero profit" sale price. 

Table shows: 
<div class="calculator-value ng-binding">$ 13.39</div>
1. Current prices
2. Recent changes
3. Highs, lows
- Better than graphs. How? 

- Page to gather stats.
-- Diff the 3 coins.
